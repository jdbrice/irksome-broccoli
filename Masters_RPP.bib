  abstract = {The STAR Time Projection Chamber (TPC) is used to record collisions at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC). The TPC is the central element in a suite of detectors that surrounds the interaction vertex. The TPC provides complete coverage around the beam-line, and provides complete tracking for charged particles within +- 1.8 units of pseudo-rapidity of the center-of-mass frame. Charged particles with momenta greater than 100 MeV/c are recorded. Multiplicities in excess of 3,000 tracks per event are routinely reconstructed in the software. The TPC measures 4 m in diameter by 4.2 m long, making it the largest TPC in the world.},

  abstract = {The 2x3 channel pseudo Vertex Position Detector (pVPD) in the STAR experiment at RHIC has been upgraded to a 2x19 channel detector in the same acceptance, called the Vertex Position Detector (VPD). This detector is fully integrated into the STAR trigger system and provides the primary input to the minimum-bias trigger in Au+Au collisions. The information from the detector is used both in the STAR Level-0 trigger and offline to measure the location of the primary collision vertex along the beam pipe and the event "start time" needed by other fast-timing detectors in STAR. The offline timing resolution of single detector channels in full-energy Au+Au collisions is {\textasciitilde}100 ps, resulting in a start time resolution of a few tens of picoseconds and a resolution on the primary vertex location of {\textasciitilde}1 cm.},

Our framework is the confining and chiral invariant quark model, related to truncated Coulomb gauge QCD. Since we are dealing with light quarks, where the linear potential dominates the quark condensate and the spectrum, we only specialize in the linear confining potential for the quark-antiquark interaction. We utilize T dependent string tensions previously fitted from lattice QCD data, and a fit of previously computed dynamically generated constituent quark masses. We scan the T effects on the constituent quark mass, on the meson spectra and on the polyakov loop.},

  abstract = {This is a review of the theoretical background, experimental techniques, and phenomenology of what is called the "Glauber Model" in relativistic heavy ion physics. This model is used to calculate "geometric" quantities, which are typically expressed as impact parameter (b), number of participating nucleons (N\_part) and number of binary nucleon-nucleon collisions (N\_coll). A brief history of the original Glauber model is presented, with emphasis on its development into the purely classical, geometric picture that is used for present-day data analyses. Distinctions are made between the "optical limit" and Monte Carlo approaches, which are often used interchangably but have some essential differences in particular contexts. The methods used by the four RHIC experiments are compared and contrasted, although the end results are reassuringly similar for the various geometric observables. Finally, several important RHIC measurements are highlighted that rely on geometric quantities, estimated from Glauber calculations, to draw insight from experimental observables. The status and future of Glauber modeling in the next generation of heavy ion physics studies is briefly discussed.},

The design of the system and its performance during the 2001 RHIC run will be described. The start resolution attained by the pVPD was 24 ps, implying a pVPD single-detector resolution of 58 ps.

A large, approximately constant hadron suppression is observed in central Au+Au collisions for 5\ensuremath{<}pT\ensuremath{<}12 GeV/c. The collision energy dependence of the yields and the centrality and pT dependence of the suppression provide stringent constraints on theoretical models of suppression. Models incorporating initial-state gluon saturation or partonic energy loss in dense matter are largely consistent with observations. We observe no evidence of pT-dependent suppression, which may be expected from models incorporating jet attenuation in cold nuclear matter or scattering of fragmentation hadrons.},

  abstract = {Hadrons containing heavy quarks are a clean probe of the early dynamic evolution of the dense and hot medium created in high-energy nuclear collisions. To explore heavy quark production at RHIC, the Heavy Flavor Tracker (HFT) for the STAR experiment was built and installed in time for RHIC Run 14. The HFT consists of four layers of silicon detectors. The two outermost layers are silicon strip detectors and the two innermost layers are made from state-of-the-art ultra-thin CMOS Monolithic Active Pixel Sensors (MAPS). This is the first application of a CMOS MAPS detector in a collider experiment. The use of thin pixel sensors plus the use of carbon fiber supporting material limits the material budget to be only 0.4\% radiation length per pixel detector layer, enabling the reconstruction of low p T heavy flavor hadrons. The status and performance of the HFT in the RHIC 200 GeV Au\hspace{0.167em}+\hspace{0.167em}Au run in 2014 are reported. Very good detector efficiency, hit residuals and track resolution (DCAs) were observed in the cosmic ray data and in the Au\hspace{0.167em}+\hspace{0.167em}Au data.},

  abstract = {The heavy quark hadrons are suggested as a clean probe for studying the early dynamic evolution of the dense and hot medium created in high-energy nuclear collisions. The Heavy Flavor Tracker (HFT) of the STAR experiment, designed to improve the vertex resolution and extend the measurement capabilities in the heavy flavor domain, was installed for the 2014 heavy ion run of RHIC. It is composed of three different silicon detectors arranged in four concentric cylinders close to the STAR interaction point. The two innermost layers are based on CMOS monolithic active pixels (MAPS), featured for the first time in a collider experiment, and the two outer layers are based on pads and strips. The two innermost HFT layers are placed at a radius of 2.8 and 8{\textasciitilde}cm from the beam line and accommodate 400 ultra-thin ({\textdollar}50 \ensuremath{\backslash}mu m{\textdollar}) high resolution MAPS sensors arranged in 10-sensor ladders to cover a total silicon area of {\textdollar}0.16m\^{}\{2\}{\textdollar}. Each sensor includes a pixel array of 928 rows and 960 columns with a {\textdollar}20.7\ensuremath{\backslash}mu m{\textdollar} pixel pitch, providing a sensitive area of {\textdollar}\ensuremath{\backslash}sim 3.8 cm\^{}\{2\}{\textdollar}. The sensor features {\textdollar}185.6 \ensuremath{\backslash}mu s{\textdollar} readout time and {\textdollar}170 mW/cm\^{}\{2\}{\textdollar} power dissipation, allowing it to be air cooled, which results in a global material budget of only 0.5\% radiation length per layer in the run 14 detector. A novel mechanical approach to detector insertion enables effective installation and integration of the pixel layers within a 12 hour shift during the on-going STAR Run. After a detailed description of the design specifications and the technology implementation, the detector status and operations during the 200 GeV Au+Au RHIC run of 2014 will be presented in this paper. A preliminary estimation of the detector performance meeting the design requirements will be reported.},

  abstract = {The Quark Matter 2015 is the XXV international conference on ultrarelativistic heavy-ion collisions. The aim of this conference is to unravel mystery of strongly interacting matter at extreme environments created in the ultrarelativistic heavy-ion collisions, in early universe, and in the central core of superdense stars. Both the theoretical and experimental physicists from all over the world get together for every 1.5 years to exchange information on the forefront researches in this field and},
